# Kohya's GUI

This repository repository is providing a Gradio GUI for kohya's Stable Diffusion trainers found here: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts. The GUI allow you to set the training parameters and generate and run the required CLI command to train the model.

## Required Dependencies

Python 3.10.6+ and Git:

- Install Python 3.10 using https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe (make sure to tick the box to add Python to the environment path)
- git: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 redistributable: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

## Installation

Give unrestricted script access to powershell so venv can work:

- Open an administrator powershell window
- Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` and answer A
- Close admin powershell window

Open a regular user Powershell terminal and type the following inside:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
cd kohya_ss

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install --use-pep517 --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip install -U -I --no-deps https://github.com/C43H66N12O12S2/stable-diffusion-webui/releases/download/f/xformers-0.0.14.dev0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\*.dll .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\
cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\cextension.py .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cextension.py
cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\main.py .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cuda_setup\main.py

accelerate config

```

### Optional: CUDNN 8.6

This step is optional but can improve the learning speed for NVidia 30X0/40X0 owners... It allows larger training batch size and faster training speed

Due to the filesize I can't host the DLLs needed for CUDNN 8.6 on Github, I strongly advise you download them for a speed boost in sample generation (almost 50% on 4090) you can download them from here: https://b1.thefileditch.ch/mwxKTEtelILoIbMbruuM.zip

To install simply unzip the directory and place the cudnn_windows folder in the root of the kohya_diffusers_fine_tuning repo.

Run the following command to install:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python .\tools\cudann_1.8_install.py
```

## Upgrade

When a new release comes out you can upgrade your repo with the following command:

```powershell
cd kohya_ss
git pull
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --use-pep517 --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Once the commands have completed successfully you should be ready to use the new version.

## Launching the GUI

To run the GUI you simply use this command:

```
.\gui.ps1
```

or you can alsi do:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python.exe .\kohya_gui.py
```

## Dreambooth

You can find the dreambooth solution spercific [Dreambooth README](train_db_README.md)

## Finetune

You can find the finetune solution spercific [Finetune README](fine_tune_README.md)

## Train Network

You can find the train network solution spercific [Train network README](train_network_README.md)

## LoRA

Training a LoRA currently use the `train_network.py` python code. You can create LoRA network by using the all-in-one `gui.cmd` or by running the dedicated LoRA training GUI with:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python lora_gui.py
```

Once you have created the LoRA network you can generate images via auto1111 by installing the extension found here: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks

## Troubleshooting

### Page file limit

- if get X error relating to `page file`, increase page file size limit in Windows

### No module called tkinter

- Re-install python 3.10.x on your system: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe

### FileNotFoundError

This is usually related to an installation issue. Make sure you do not have python modules installed locally that could conflict with the ones installed in the venv:

1. Open a new powershell terminal and make sure no venv is active.
2.  Run the following commands

```
pip freeze > uninstall.txt
pip uninstall -r uninstall.txt
```

Then redo the installation instruction within the kohya_ss venv.

## Change history

* 2023/01/26 (v20.5.0):
    - Add new `Dreambooth TI` tab for training of Textual Inversion embeddings
    - Add Textual Inversion training. Documentation is [here](./train_ti_README-ja.md) (in Japanese.)
* 2023/01/22 (v20.4.1):
    - Add new tool to verify LoRA weights produced by the trainer. Can be found under "Dreambooth LoRA/Tools/Verify LoRA"
* 2023/01/22 (v20.4.0):
    - Add support for `network_alpha` under the Training tab and support for `--training_comment` under the Folders tab.
    - Add ``--network_alpha`` option to specify ``alpha`` value to prevent underflows for stable training. Thanks to CCRcmcpe!
        - Details of the issue are described in https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks/issues/49 .
        - The default value is ``1``, scale ``1 / rank (or dimension)``. Set same value as ``network_dim`` for same behavior to old version.
        - LoRA with a large dimension (rank) seems to require a higher learning rate with ``alpha=1`` (e.g. 1e-3 for 128-dim, still investigating).ã€€
    - For generating images in Web UI, __the latest version of the extension ``sd-webui-additional-networks`` (v0.3.0 or later) is required for the models trained with this release or later.__
    - Add logging for the learning rate for U-Net and Text Encoder independently, and for running average epoch loss. Thanks to mgz-dev!  
    - Add more metadata such as dataset/reg image dirs, session ID, output name etc... See https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/77 for details. Thanks to space-nuko!
        - __Now the metadata includes the folder name (the basename of the folder contains image files, not fullpath).__ If you do not want it, disable metadata storing with ``--no_metadata`` option.
    - Add ``--training_comment`` option. You can specify an arbitrary string and refer to it by the extension.

It seems that the Stable Diffusion web UI now supports image generation using the LoRA model learned in this repository.

Note: At this time, it appears that models learned with version 0.4.0 are not supported. If you want to use the generation function of the web UI, please continue to use version 0.3.2. Also, it seems that LoRA models for SD2.x are not supported.

* 2023/01/16 (v20.3.0):
  - Fix a part of LoRA modules are not trained when ``gradient_checkpointing`` is enabled. 
  - Add ``--save_last_n_epochs_state`` option. You can specify how many state folders to keep, apart from how many models to keep. Thanks to shirayu!
  - Fix Text Encoder training stops at ``max_train_steps`` even if ``max_train_epochs`` is set in `train_db.py``.
  - Added script to check LoRA weights. You can check weights by ``python networks\check_lora_weights.py <model file>``. If some modules are not trained, the value is ``0.0`` like following. 
    - ``lora_te_text_model_encoder_layers_11_*`` is not trained with ``clip_skip=2``, so ``0.0`` is okay for these modules.

- example result of ``check_lora_weights.py``, Text Encoder and a part of U-Net are not trained:
```
number of LoRA-up modules: 264
lora_te_text_model_encoder_layers_0_mlp_fc1.lora_up.weight,0.0

- all modules are trained:

```
* 2023/01/16 (v20.2.1):
    - Merging latest code update from kohya
    - Added `--max_train_epochs` and `--max_data_loader_n_workers` option for each training script.
    - If you specify the number of training epochs with `--max_train_epochs`, the number of steps is calculated from the number of epochs automatically.
    - You can set the number of workers for DataLoader with `--max_data_loader_n_workers`, default is 8. The lower number may reduce the main memory usage and the time between epochs, but may cause slower dataloading (training).
    - Fix loading some VAE or .safetensors as VAE is failed for `--vae` option. Thanks to Fannovel16!
    - Add negative prompt scaling for `gen_img_diffusers.py` You can set another conditioning scale to the negative prompt with `--negative_scale` option, and `--nl` option for the prompt. Thanks to laksjdjf!
