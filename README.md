# Kohya's dreambooth and finetuning

This repository now includes the solutions provided by Kohya_ss in a single location. I have combined both solutions under one repository to align with the new official Kohya repository where he will maintain his code from now on: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts.

A note accompanying the release of his new repository can be found here: https://note.com/kohya_ss/n/nba4eceaa4594

## Dreambooth

You can find the dreambooth solution spercific [Dreambooth README](README_dreambooth.md)

## Finetune

You can find the finetune solution spercific [Finetune README](README_finetune.md)

## LoRA

You can create LoRA network by running the dedicated GUI with:

```
python lora_gui.py
```

or via the all in one GUI:

```
python kahya_gui.py
```

Once you have created the LoRA network you can generate images via auto1111 by installing the extension found here: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks
