# Kohya's dreambooth and finetuning

This repository now includes the solutions provided by Kohya_ss in a single location. I have combined both solutions under one repository to align with the new official Kohya repository where he will maintain his code from now on: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts.

A note accompanying the release of his new repository can be found here: https://note.com/kohya_ss/n/nba4eceaa4594

## Required Dependencies

Python 3.10.6+ and Git:

- Python 3.10.6+: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe
- git: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Give unrestricted script access to powershell so venv can work:

- Open an administrator powershell window
- Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` and answer A
- Close admin powershell window

## Installation

Open a regular Powershell terminal and type the following inside:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
cd kohya_ss

python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip install -U -I --no-deps https://github.com/C43H66N12O12S2/stable-diffusion-webui/releases/download/f/xformers-0.0.14.dev0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\*.dll .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\
cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\cextension.py .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cextension.py
cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\main.py .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cuda_setup\main.py

accelerate config

```

### Optional: CUDNN 8.6

This step is optional but can improve the learning speed for NVidia 4090 owners...

Due to the filesize I can't host the DLLs needed for CUDNN 8.6 on Github, I strongly advise you download them for a speed boost in sample generation (almost 50% on 4090) you can download them from here: https://b1.thefileditch.ch/mwxKTEtelILoIbMbruuM.zip

To install simply unzip the directory and place the cudnn_windows folder in the root of the kohya_diffusers_fine_tuning repo.

Run the following command to install:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python .\tools\cudann_1.8_install.py
```

## Upgrade

When a new release comes out you can upgrade your repo with the following command:

```powershell
cd kohya_ss
git pull
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Once the commands have completed successfully you should be ready to use the new version.

## Launching the GUI

To run the GUI you simply use this command:

```
gui.ps1
```

## Dreambooth

You can find the dreambooth solution spercific [Dreambooth README](train_db_README.md)

## Finetune

You can find the finetune solution spercific [Finetune README](fine_tune_README.md)

## Train Network

You can find the train network solution spercific [Train network README](train_network_README.md)

## LoRA

Training a LoRA currently use the `train_network.py` python code. You can create LoRA network by using the all-in-one `gui.cmd` or by running the dedicated LoRA training GUI with:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python lora_gui.py
```

Once you have created the LoRA network you can generate images via auto1111 by installing the extension found here: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks
